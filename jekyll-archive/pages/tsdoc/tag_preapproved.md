**Tag type:** modifier

**TSDoc standardization:** *none; this tag is proprietary to API Extractor*

Even though an API is marked as `@internal`, its signature will still be tracked in the API report
file (\*.api.md file) because an API review process is often interested in internal APIs.  We may ask
questions such as:

- *"Will this change cause a break for other internal packages?"*
- *"Should we consider making this a `@public` API instead?"*
- *"Why do we keep adding more stuff to that huge "`InternalUtilities`" class?"*

However, if it is not useful to review a certain API, it can be marked as `@preapproved`.  This prevents it from
being emitted in the API file, and thus exempts it from any review policies.

The `@preapproved` tag is only supported for declarations marked as `@internal`, and only for the following
declaration types:

- classes
- enums
- interfaces
- namespaces

**Usage example:**

```ts
/**
 * Identifiers for various log messages.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * These tokens are generated by the tooling system, so there is no reason
 * to review them.
 *
 * @internal @preapproved
 */
export enum _LoggingIds {
  ...
}
```
