The API Extractor project is coordinated by a team within MS Office.  Although Microsoft does not provide official
support for API Extractor, there are various community options for help:

- **Found a bug?** You can [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues)
  in the **rushstack** monorepo where API Extractor is developed

- **Zulip**: Chat with API Extractor developers in the Rush Stack
  [Zulip chat room](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262521-api-extractor)

- **If a PR needs attention,** try asking in the
  [#contributor-helpline](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/279883-contributor-helpline)
  chat room.  We carefully review each submission before merging, which is time consuming work.  The maintainers
  are all people who manage large corporate monorepos with regular daily distractions, so PRs frequently
  get overlooked.  Your contributions are greatly appreciated -- we do want to get that PR reviewed!
