*"Incorrect file type; API Extractor expects to analyze compiler outputs with the .d.ts file extension."*

## Remarks

Unlike some other tools, API Extractor does not process TypeScript source files directly.  Instead, it is
designed to analyze the .d.ts files that are emitted by the compiler and exported by your NPM package.
This design choice ensures that API Extractor sees your library the same way that an external consumer
will see it.  It also ensures that the .d.ts rollup preserves the particular syntax choices of
your toolchain, compiler version, and manually authored inputs.

As a result, your `mainEntryPointFilePath` must have the .d.ts file extension, and so must all of
the imported modules.  An `ae-wrong-input-file-type` error is reported if any incorrect file extensions
are encountered.


## How to fix

To reduce log noise, the `ae-wrong-input-file-type` error is reported at most once.  To see the full list
of imported paths, invoke API Extractor with the `--diagnostics` parameter, then look for any file paths
that have a problematic file extension such as `.ts` or `.tsx`.  Try to determine why that file is being
imported instead of the corresponding `.d.ts` file.

Common issues:

- Are you invoking API Extractor before the compiler has produced any .d.ts outputs?
  Ensure that your toolchain writes .d.ts files before API Extractor is invoked.

- Is your compiler writing `example.d.ts` into the same file folder as `example.ts`? This is a poor practice.
  Consider separating input and output files, for example `src/{*.ts,*.tsx}` versus `lib/{*.js,*.d.ts}`.

- Is an NPM package dependency exporting TypeScript source files instead of .d.ts declaration files?
  Ask the package maintainer to follow standard practice of distributing prebuilt outputs,
  not source code.

As a temporary mitigation, you can disable the `ae-wrong-input-file-type` validation by adding a section
like this to your **api-extractor.json** file:

```js
  "messages": {
    "extractorMessageReporting": {
      // Disable this validation at your own risk:  Processing an incorrect file type
      // may lead to other errors.  Function bodies may incorrectly get emitted in the
      // .d.ts rollup.
      "ae-wrong-input-file-type": {
        "logLevel": "none"
      }
    }
  }
```
